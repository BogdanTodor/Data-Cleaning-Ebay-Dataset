**Welcome to my data cleaning and exploration project for the Ebay Kleinanzeigen dataset**

An important note is to view the .html version of the notebook as there are some rendering issues with the notebook. 
To address this issue I have converted the notebook using NbConvertApp.

Learning outcomes:
* Learnt how to various types of column data such as numerics, strings and dates
* Learnt fundamental ways to compare row values
* Learnt to evaluate the distribution of the data
* Learnt how to explore a dataset and look for trends
